ID, Name, Display Order
# First column is the ID and *MUST* be in contiguous order from zero to ...?
# Second column is the name or description of the device type.
# Third column is the order to display in.  Should be contiguous from zero to ...?
#   but won't cause serious problems if there are duplicates or missing numbers.
#     (But if so they may not sort into the display order you want!)
#       You will probably want to display them in order from most used to the rarest. (but hey that's up to you)
# First device type with ID of 0 is reserved for unknown/unclassified/whuteva
